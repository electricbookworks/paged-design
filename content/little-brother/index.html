        <blockquote>
            <p><i>This chapter is dedicated to BakkaPhoenix Books in Toronto,
Canada. Bakka is the oldest science fiction bookstore in the world,
and it made me the mutant I am today. I wandered in for the first
time around the age of 10 and asked for some recommendations. Tanya
Huff (yes,</i> the <i>Tanya Huff, but she wasn't a famous writer
back then!) took me back into the used section and pressed a copy
of H. Beam Piper's "Little Fuzzy" into my hands, and changed my
life forever. By the time I was 18, I was working at Bakka — I took
over from Tanya when she retired to write full time — and I learned
life-long lessons about how and why people buy books. I think every
writer should work at a bookstore (and plenty of writers have
worked at Bakka over the years! For the 30th anniversary of the
store, they put together an anthology of stories by Bakka writers
than included work by Michelle Sagara (AKA Michelle West), Tanya
Huff, Nalo Hopkinson, Tara Tallan —and me!)</i></p>

        <p class="first">I'm a senior at Cesar Chavez high in San Francisco's sunny
            Mission district, and that makes me one of the most surveilled
            people in the world. My name is Marcus Yallow, but back when this
            story starts, I was going by w1n5t0n. Pronounced "Winston."</p>
        <p><i>Not</i> pronounced "Double-you-one-enn-five-tee-zero-enn" —
            unless you're a clueless disciplinary officer who's far enough
            behind the curve that you still call the Internet "the information
            superhighway."</p>
        <p>I know just such a clueless person, and his name is Fred Benson,
            one of three vice-principals at Cesar Chavez. He's a sucking chest
            wound of a human being. But if you're going to have a jailer,
            better a clueless one than one who's really on the ball.</p>
        <p>"Marcus Yallow," he said over the PA one Friday morning. The PA
            isn't very good to begin with, and when you combine that with
            Benson's habitual mumble, you get something that sounds more like
            someone struggling to digest a bad burrito than a school
            announcement. But human beings are good at picking their names out
            of audio confusion — it's a survival trait.</p>
        <p>I grabbed my bag and folded my laptop three-quarters shut — I
            didn't want to blow my downloads — and got ready for the
            inevitable.</p>
        <p>"Report to the administration office immediately."</p>
        <p>My social studies teacher, Ms Galvez, rolled her eyes at me and
            I rolled my eyes back at her. The Man was always coming down on me,
            just because I go through school firewalls like wet kleenex, spoof
            the gait-recognition software, and nuke the snitch chips they track
            us with. Galvez is a good type, anyway, never holds that against me
            (especially when I'm helping get with her webmail so she can talk
            to her brother who's stationed in Iraq).</p>
        <p>My boy Darryl gave me a smack on the ass as I walked past. I've
            known Darryl since we were still in diapers and escaping from
            play-school, and I've been getting him into and out of trouble the
            whole time. I raised my arms over my head like a prizefighter and
            made my exit from Social Studies and began the perp-walk to the
            office.</p>
        <p>I was halfway there when my phone went. That was another no-no —
            phones are muy prohibido at Chavez High — but why should that stop
            me? I ducked into the toilet and shut myself in the middle stall
            (the furthest stall is always grossest because so many people head
            straight for it, hoping to escape the smell and the squick — the
            smart money and good hygiene is down the middle). I checked the
            phone — my home PC had sent it an email to tell it that there was
            something new up on Harajuku Fun Madness, which happens to be the
            best game ever invented.</p>
        <p>I grinned. Spending Fridays at school was teh suck anyway, and I
            was glad of the excuse to make my escape.</p>
        <p>I ambled the rest of the way to Benson's office and tossed him a
            wave as I sailed through the door.</p>
        <p>"If it isn't Double-you-one-enn-five-tee-zero-enn," he said.
            Fredrick Benson — Social Security number 545-03-2343, date of birth
            August 15 1962, mother's maiden name Di Bona, hometown Petaluma —
            is a lot taller than me. I'm a runty 5'8", while he stands 6'7",
            and his college basketball days are far enough behind him that his
            chest muscles have turned into saggy man-boobs that were painfully
            obvious through his freebie dot-com polo-shirts. He always looks
            like he's about to slam-dunk your ass, and he's really into raising
            his voice for dramatic effect. Both these start to lose their
            efficacy with repeated application.</p>
        <p>"Sorry, nope," I said. "I never heard of this R2D2 character of
            yours."</p>
        <p>"W1n5t0n," he said, spelling it out again. He gave me a hairy
            eyeball and waited for me to wilt. Of course it was my handle, and
            had been for years. It was the identity I used when I was posting
            on message-boards where I was making my contributions to the field
            of applied security research. You know, like sneaking out of school
            and disabling the minder-tracer on my phone. But he didn't know
            that this was my handle. Only a small number of people did, and I
            trusted them all to the end of the earth.</p>
        <p>"Um, not ringing any bells," I said. I'd done some pretty cool
            stuff around school using that handle — I was very proud of my work
            on snitch-tag killers — and if he could link the two identities,
            I'd be in trouble. No one at school ever called me w1n5t0n or even
            Winston. Not even my pals. It was Marcus or nothing.</p>
        <p>Benson settled down behind his desk and tapped his class-ring
            nervously on his blotter. He did this whenever things started to go
            bad for him. Poker players call stuff like this a "tell" —
            something that let you know what was going on in the other guy's
            head. I knew Benson's tells backwards and forwards.</p>
        <p>"Marcus, I hope you realize how serious this is."</p>
        <p>"I will just as soon as you explain what this is, sir." I always
            say "sir" to authority figures when I'm messing with them. It's my
            own tell.</p>
        <p>He shook his head at me and looked down, another tell. Any
            second now, he was going to start shouting at me. "Listen, kiddo!
            It's time you came to grips with the fact that we know about what
            you've been doing, and that we're not going to be lenient about it.
            You're going to be lucky if you're not expelled before this meeting
            is through. Do you want to graduate?"</p>
        <p>"Mr Benson, you still haven't explained what the problem is
            —"</p>
        <p>He slammed his hand down on the desk and then pointed his finger
            at me. "The <i>problem</i>, Mr Yallow, is that you've been engaged
            in criminal conspiracy to subvert this school's security system,
            and you have supplied security countermeasures to your fellow
            students. You know that we expelled Graciella Uriarte last week for
            using one of your devices." Uriarte had gotten a bad rap. She'd
            bought a radio-jammer from a head-shop near the 16th Street BART
            station and it had set off the countermeasures in the school
            hallway. Not my doing, but I felt for her.</p>
        <p>"And you think I'm involved in that?"</p>
        <p>"We have reliable intelligence indicating that you are w1n5t0n"
            — again, he spelled it out, and I began to wonder if he hadn't
            figured out that the 1 was an I and the 5 was an S. "We know that
            this w1n5t0n character is reponsible for the theft of last year's
            standardized tests." That actually hadn't been me, but it was a
            sweet hack, and it was kind of flattering to hear it attributed to
            me. "And therefore liable for several years in prison unless you
            cooperate with me."</p>
        <p>"You have 'reliable intelligence'? I'd like to see it."</p>
        <p>He glowered at me. "Your attitude isn't going to help you."</p>
        <p>"If there's evidence, sir, I think you should call the police
            and turn it over to them. It sounds like this is a very serious
            matter, and I wouldn't want to stand in the way of a proper
            investigation by the duly constituted authorities."</p>
        <p>"You want me to call the police."</p>
        <p>"And my parents, I think. That would be for the best."</p>
        <p>We stared at each other across the desk. He'd clearly expected
            me to fold the second he dropped the bomb on me. I don't fold. I
            have a trick for staring down people like Benson. I look slightly
            to the left of their heads, and think about the lyrics to old Irish
            folk songs, the kinds with three hundred verses. It makes me look
            perfectly composed and unworried.</p>
        <p><i>And the wing was on the bird and the bird was on the egg and
the egg was in the nest and the nest was on the leaf and the leaf
was on the twig and the twig was on the branch and the branch was
on the limb and the limb was in the tree and the tree was in the
bog — the bog down in the valley-oh! High-ho the rattlin' bog, the
bog down in the valley-oh</i> —</p>
        <p>"You can return to class now," he said. "I'll call on you once
            the police are ready to speak to you."</p>
        <p>"Are you going to call them now?"</p>
        <p>"The procedure for calling in the police is complicated. I'd
            hoped that we could settle this fairly and quickly, but since you
            insist —"</p>
        <p>"I can wait while you call them is all," I said. "I don't
            mind."</p>
        <p>He tapped his ring again and I braced for the blast.</p>
        <p>"<i>Go!</i>" he yelled. "Get the hell out of my office, you
            miserable little —"</p>
        <p>I got out, keeping my expression neutral. He wasn't going to
            call the cops. If he'd had enough evidence to go to the police
            with, he would have called them in the first place. He hated my
            guts. I figured he'd heard some unverified gossip and hoped to
            spook me into confirming it.</p>
        <p>I moved down the corridor lightly and sprightly, keeping my gait
            even and measured for the gait-recognition cameras. These had been
            installed only a year before, and I loved them for their sheer
            idiocy. Beforehand, we'd had face-recognition cameras covering
            nearly every public space in school, but a court ruled that was
            unconstitutional. So Benson and a lot of other paranoid school
            administrators had spent our textbook dollars on these idiot
            cameras that were supposed to be able to tell one person's walk
            from another. Yeah, right.</p>
        <p>I got back to class and sat down again, Ms Galvez warmly
            welcoming me back. I unpacked the school's standard-issue machine
            and got back into classroom mode. The SchoolBooks were the
            snitchiest technology of them all, logging every keystroke,
            watching all the network traffic for suspicious keywords, counting
            every click, keeping track of every fleeting thought you put out
            over the net. We'd gotten them in my junior year, and it only took
            a couple months for the shininess to wear off. Once people figured
            out that these "free" laptops worked for the man — and showed a
            never-ending parade of obnoxious ads to boot — they suddenly
            started to feel very heavy and burdensome.</p>
        <p>Cracking my SchoolBook had been easy. The crack was online
            within a month of the machine showing up, and there was nothing to
            it — just download a DVD image, burn it, stick it in the
            SchoolBook, and boot it while holding down a bunch of different
            keys at the same time. The DVD did the rest, installing a whole
            bunch of hidden programs on the machine, programs that would stay
            hidden even when the Board of Ed did its daily remote integrity
            checks of the machines. Every now and again I had to get an update
            for the software to get around the Board's latest tests, but it was
            a small price to pay to get a little control over the box.</p>
        <p>I fired up IMParanoid, the secret instant messenger that I used
            when I wanted to have an off-the-record discussion right in the
            middle of class. Darryl was already logged in.</p>
        <p>&gt; The game's afoot! Something big is going down with Harajuku
            Fun Madness, dude. You in?</p>
        <p>&gt; No. Freaking. Way. If I get caught ditching a third time,
            I'm expelled. Man, you know that. We'll go after school.</p>
        <p>&gt; You've got lunch and then study-hall, right? That's two
            hours. Plenty of time to run down this clue and get back before
            anyone misses us. I'll get the whole team out.</p>
        <p>Harajuku Fun Madness is the best game ever made. I know I
            already said that, but it bears repeating. It's an ARG, an
            Alternate Reality Game, and the story goes that a gang of Japanese
            fashion-teens discovered a miraculous healing gem at the temple in
            Harajuku, which is basically where cool Japanese teenagers invented
            every major subculture for the past ten years. They're being hunted
            by evil monks, the Yakuza (AKA the Japanese mafia), aliens,
            tax-inspectors, parents, and a rogue artificial intelligence. They
            slip the players coded messages that we have to decode and use to
            track down clues that lead to more coded messages and more
            clues.</p>
        <p>Imagine the best afternoon you've ever spent prowling the
            streets of a city, checking out all the weird people, funny
            hand-bills, street-maniacs, and funky shops. Now add a scavenger
            hunt to that, one that requires you to research crazy old films and
            songs and teen culture from around the world and across time and
            space. And it's a competition, with the winning team of four taking
            a grand prize of ten days in Tokyo, chilling on Harajuku bridge,
            geeking out in Akihabara, and taking home all the Astro Boy
            merchandise you can eat. Except that he's called "Atom Boy" in
            Japan.</p>
        <p>That's Harajuku Fun Madness, and once you've solved a puzzle or
            two, you'll never look back.</p>
        <p>&gt; No man, just no. NO. Don't even ask.</p>
        <p>&gt; I need you D. You're the best I've got. I swear I'll get us
            in and out without anyone knowing it. You know I can do that,
            right?</p>
        <p>&gt; I know you can do it</p>
        <p>&gt; So you're in?</p>
        <p>&gt; Hell no</p>
        <p>&gt; Come on, Darryl. You're not going to your deathbed wishing
            you'd spent more study periods sitting in school</p>
        <p>&gt; I'm not going to go to my deathbed wishing I'd spent more
            time playing ARGs either</p>
        <p>&gt; Yeah but don't you think you might go to your death-bed
            wishing you'd spent more time with Vanessa Pak?</p>
        <p>Van was part of my team. She went to a private girl's school in
            the East Bay, but I knew she'd ditch to come out and run the
            mission with me. Darryl has had a crush on her literally for years
            — even before puberty endowed her with many lavish gifts. Darryl
            had fallen in love with her mind. Sad, really.</p>
        <p>&gt; You suck</p>
        <p>&gt; You're coming?</p>
        <p>He looked at me and shook his head. Then he nodded. I winked at
            him and set to work getting in touch with the rest of my team.</p>
        <p><br />
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>I wasn't always into ARGing. I have a dark secret: I used to be
            a LARPer. LARPing is Live Action Role Playing, and it's just about
            what it sounds like: running around in costume, talking in a funny
            accent, pretending to be a super-spy or a vampire or a medieval
            knight. It's like Capture the Flag in monster-drag, with a bit of
            Drama Club thrown in, and the best games were the ones we played in
            Scout Camps out of town in Sonoma or down on the Peninsula. Those
            three-day epics could get pretty hairy, with all-day hikes, epic
            battles with foam-and-bamboo swords, casting spells by throwing
            beanbags and shouting "Fireball!" and so on. Good fun, if a little
            goofy. Not nearly as geeky as talking about what your elf planned
            on doing as you sat around a table loaded with Diet Coke cans and
            painted miniatures, and more physically active than going into a
            mouse-coma in front of a massively multiplayer game at home.</p>
        <p>The thing that got me into trouble were the mini-games in the
            hotels. Whenever a science fiction convention came to town, some
            LARPer would convince them to let us run a couple of six-hour
            mini-games at the con, piggybacking on their rental of the space.
            Having a bunch of enthusiastic kids running around in costume lent
            color to the event, and we got to have a ball among people even
            more socially deviant than us.</p>
        <p>The problem with hotels is that they have a lot of non-gamers in
            them, too — and not just sci-fi people. Normal people. From states
            that begin and end with vowels. On holidays.</p>
        <p>And sometimes those people misunderstand the nature of a
            game.</p>
        <p>Let's just leave it at that, OK?</p>
        <p><br />
            <br />

        <p>Class ended in ten minutes, and that didn't leave me with much
            time to prepare. The first order of business were those pesky
            gait-recognition cameras. Like I said, they'd started out as
            face-recognition cameras, but those had been ruled
            unconstitutional. As far as I know, no court has yet determined
            whether these gait-cams are any more legal, but until they do,
            we're stuck with them.</p>
        <p>"Gait" is a fancy word for the way you walk. People are pretty
            good at spotting gaits — next time you're on a camping trip, check
            out the bobbing of the flashlight as a distant friend approaches
            you. Chances are you can identify him just from the movement of the
            light, the characteristic way it bobs up and down that tells our
            monkey brains that this is a person approaching us.</p>
        <p>Gait recognition software takes pictures of your motion, tries
            to isolate you in the pics as a silhouette, and then tries to match
            the silhouette to a database to see if it knows who you are. It's a
            biometric identifier, like fingerprints or retina-scans, but it's
            got a lot more "collisions" than either of those. A biometric
            "collision" is when a measurement matches more than one person.
            Only you have your fingerprint, but you share your gait with plenty
            other people.</p>
        <p>Not exactly, of course. Your personal, inch-by-inch walk is
            yours and yours alone. The problem is your inch-by-inch walk
            changes based on how tired you are, what the floor is made of,
            whether you pulled your ankle playing basketball, and whether
            you've changed your shoes lately. So the system kind of fuzzes-out
            your profile, looking for people who walk kind of like you.</p>
        <p>There are a lot of people who walk kind of like you. What's
            more, it's easy not to walk kind of like you — just take one shoe
            off. Of course, you'll always walk like you-with-one-shoe-off in
            that case, so the cameras will eventually figure out that it's
            still you. Which is why I prefer to inject a little randomness into
            my attacks on gait-recognition: I put a handful of gravel into each
            shoe. Cheap and effective, and no two steps are the same. Plus you
            get a great reflexology foot massage in the process (I kid.
            Reflexology is about as scientifically useful as
            gait-recognition).</p>
        <p>The cameras used to set off an alert every time someone they
            didn't recognize stepped onto campus.</p>
        <p>This did <i>not</i> work.</p>
        <p>The alarm went off every ten minutes. When the mailman came by.
            When a parent dropped in. When the grounds-people went to work
            fixing up the basketball court. When a student showed up wearing
            new shoes.</p>
        <p>So now it just tries to keep track of who's where and when. If
            someone leaves by the school-gates during classes, their gait is
            checked to see if it kinda-sorta matches any student gait and if it
            does, whoop-whoop-whoop, ring the alarm!</p>
        <p>Chavez High is ringed with gravel walkways. I like to keep a
            couple handsful of rocks in my shoulder-bag, just in case. I
            silently passed Darryl ten or fifteen pointy little bastards and we
            both loaded our shoes.</p>
        <p>Class was about to finish up — and I realized that I still
            hadn't checked the Harajuku Fun Madness site to see where the next
            clue was! I'd been a little hyper-focused on the escape, and hadn't
            bothered to figure out where we were escaping <i>to</i>.</p>
        <p>I turned to my SchoolBook and hit the keyboard. The web-browser
            we used was supplied with the machine. It was a locked-down spyware
            version of Internet Explorer, Microsoft's crashware turd that no
            one under the age of 40 used voluntarily.</p>
        <p>I had a copy of Firefox on the USB drive built into my watch,
            but that wasn't enough — the SchoolBook ran Windows Vista4Schools,
            an antique operating system designed to give school administrators
            the illusion that they controlled the programs their students could
            run.</p>
        <p>But Vista4Schools is its own worst enemy. There are a lot of
            programs that Vista4Schools doesn't want you to be able to shut
            down — keyloggers, censorware — and these programs run in a special
            mode that makes them invisible to the system. You can't quit them
            because you can't even see they're there.</p>
        <p>Any program whose name starts with SYS is invisible to the
            operating system. it doesn't show up on listings of the hard drive,
            nor in the process monitor. So my copy of Firefox was called
            SYSFirefox — and as I launched it, it became invisible to Windows,
            and so invisible to the network's snoopware.</p>
        <p>Now I had an indie browser running, I needed an indie network
            connection. The school's network logged every click in and out of
            the system, which was bad news if you were planning on surfing over
            to the Harajuku Fun Madness site for some extra-curricular fun.</p>
        <p>The answer is something ingenious called TOR — The Onion Router.
            An onion router is an Internet site that takes requests for
            web-pages and passes them onto other onion routers, and on to other
            onion routers, until one of them finally decides to fetch the page
            and pass it back through the layers of the onion until it reaches
            you. The traffic to the onion-routers is encrypted, which means
            that the school can't see what you're asking for, and the layers of
            the onion don't know who they're working for. There are millions of
            nodes — the program was set up by the US Office of Naval Research
            to help their people get around the censorware in countries like
            Syria and China, which means that it's perfectly designed for
            operating in the confines of an average American high school.</p>
        <p>TOR works because the school has a finite blacklist of naughty
            addresses we aren't allowed to visit, and the addresses of the
            nodes change all the time — no way could the school keep track of
            them all. Firefox and TOR together made me into the invisible man,
            impervious to Board of Ed snooping, free to check out the Harajuku
            FM site and see what was up.</p>
        <p>There it was, a new clue. Like all Harajuku Fun Madness clues,
            it had a physical, online and mental component. The online
            component was a puzzle you had to solve, one that required you to
            research the answers to a bunch of obscure questions. This batch
            included a bunch of questions on the plots in d™jinshi — those are
            comic books drawn by fans of manga, Japanese comics. They can be as
            big as the official comics that inspire them, but they're a lot
            weirder, with crossover story-lines and sometimes really silly
            songs and action. Lots of love stories, of course. Everyone loves
            to see their favorite toons hook up.</p>
        <p>I'd have to solve those riddles later, when I got home. They
            were easiest to solve with the whole team, downloading tons of
            d™jinshi files and scouring them for answers to the puzzles.</p>
        <p>I'd just finished scrap-booking all the clues when the bell rang
            and we began our escape. I surreptitiously slid the gravel down the
            side of my short boots — ankle-high Blundstones from Australia,
            great for running and climbing, and the easy slip-on/slip-off
            laceless design makes them convenient at the never-ending
            metal-detectors that are everywhere now.</p>
        <p>We also had to evade physical surveillance, of course, but that
            gets easier every time they add a new layer of physical snoopery —
            all the bells and whistles lull our beloved faculty into a totally
            false sense of security. We surfed the crowd down the hallways,
            heading for my favorite side-exit. We were halfway along when
            Darryl hissed, "Crap! I forgot, I've got a library book in my
            bag."</p>
        <p>"You're kidding me," I said, and hauled him into the next
            bathroom we passed. Library books are bad news. Every one of them
            has an arphid — Radio Frequency ID tag — glued into its binding,
            which makes it possible for the librarians to check out the books
            by waving them over a reader, and lets a library shelf tell you if
            any of the books on it are out of place.</p>
        <p>But it also lets the school track where you are at all times. It
            was another of those legal loopholes: the courts wouldn't let the
            schools track <i>us</i> with arphids, but they could track
            <i>library books</i>, and use the school records to tell them who
            was likely to be carrying which library book.</p>
        <p>I had a little Faraday pouch in my bag — these are little
            wallets lined with a mesh of copper wires that effectively block
            radio energy, silencing arphids. But the pouches were made for
            neutralizing ID cards and toll-book transponders, not books like
            —</p>
        <p>"Introduction to Physics?" I groaned. The book was the size of a
            dictionary.</p>
