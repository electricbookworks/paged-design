    <h2>About <em>Introductory Business Statistics [h2]</em></h2>
    <p class="paragraph"><em>Introductory Business Statistics</em> is designed to meet the scope and sequence
      requirements of the one-semester statistics course for business, economics, and related majors. Core statistical
      concepts and skills have been augmented with practical business examples, scenarios, and exercises. The result is
      a meaningful understanding of the discipline which will serve students in their business careers and real-world
      experiences.</p>
    <h3>Coverage and scope [h3]</h3>
    <p class="paragraph"><em>Introductory Business Statistics</em> began as a customized version of OpenStax
      <em>Introductory Statistics</em> by Barbara Illowsky and Susan Dean. Statistics faculty at The University of
      Oklahoma have used the business statistics adaptation for several years, and the author has continually refined it
      based on student success and faculty feedback.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">The book is structured in a similar manner to most traditional statistics textbooks. The most
      significant topical changes occur in the latter chapters on regression analysis. Discrete probability density
      functions have been reordered to provide a logical progression from simple counting formulas to more complex
      continuous distributions. Many additional homework assignments have been added, as well as new, more mathematical
      examples.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><em>Introductory Business Statistics</em> places a significant emphasis on the development and
      practical application of formulas so that students have a deeper understanding of their interpretation and
      application of data. To achieve this unique approach, the author included a wealth of additional material and
      purposely de-emphasized the use of the scientific calculator. Specific changes regarding formula use include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p class="paragraph">Expanded discussions of the combinatorial formulas, factorials, and sigma notation</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="paragraph">Adjustments to explanations of the acceptance/rejection rule for hypothesis testing, as
          well as a focus on terminology regarding confidence intervals</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="paragraph">Deep reliance on statistical tables for the process of finding probabilities (which would
          not be required if probabilities relied on scientific calculators)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="paragraph">Continual and emphasized links to the Central Limit Theorem throughout the book;
          <em>Introductory Business Statistics</em> consistently links each test statistic back to this fundamental
          theorem in inferential statistics</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="paragraph">Another fundamental focus of the book is the link between statistical inference and the
      scientific method. Business and economics models are fundamentally grounded in assumed relationships of cause and
      effect. They are developed to both test hypotheses and to predict from such models. This comes from the belief
      that statistics is the gatekeeper that allows some theories to remain and others to be cast aside for a new
      perspective of the world around us. This philosophical view is presented in detail throughout and informs the
      method of presenting the regression model, in particular.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">The correlation and regression chapter includes confidence intervals for predictions,
      alternative mathematical forms to allow for testing categorical variables, and the presentation of the multiple
      regression model.</p>
    <h3>Pedagogical features [h3]</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">Examples are placed strategically throughout the text to show students the step-by-step process
      of interpreting and solving statistical problems. To keep the text relevant for students, the examples are drawn
      from a broad spectrum of practical topics; these include examples about college life and learning, health and
      medicine, retail and business, and sports and entertainment.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p class="paragraph">Practice, Homework, and Bringing It Together give the students problems at various degrees
          of difficulty while also including real-world scenarios to engage students.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Additional resources [h2]</h2>
    <h3>Student and instructor resources [h3]</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">We&#x2019;ve compiled additional resources for both students and instructors, including Getting
      Started Guides, an instructor solution manual, and PowerPoint slides. Instructor resources require a verified
      instructor account, which you can apply for when you log in or create your account on OpenStax.org. Take advantage
      of these resources to supplement your OpenStax book.</p>
    <h3>Community Hubs [h3]</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">OpenStax partners with the Institute for the Study of Knowledge Management in Education (ISKME)
      to offer Community Hubs on OER Commons &#x2013; a platform for instructors to share community-created resources
      that support OpenStax books, free of charge. Through our Community Hubs, instructors can upload their own
      materials or download resources to use in their own courses, including additional ancillaries, teaching material,
      multimedia, and relevant course content. We encourage instructors to join the hubs for the subjects most relevant
      to your teaching and research as an opportunity both to enrich your courses and to engage with other faculty.

    <p class="paragraph"><em>Introductory Business Statistics</em> is designed to meet the scope and sequence
      requirements of the one-semester statistics course for business, economics, and related majors. Core statistical
      concepts and skills have been augmented with practical business examples, scenarios, and exercises. The result is
      a meaningful understanding of the discipline, which will serve students in their business careers and real-world
      experiences.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">You are probably asking yourself the question, &quot;When and where will I use
      statistics?&quot; If you read any newspaper, watch television, or use the Internet, you will see statistical
      information. There are statistics about crime, sports, education, politics, and real estate. Typically, when you
      read a newspaper article or watch a television news program, you are given sample information. With this
      information, you may make a decision about the correctness of a statement, claim, or &quot;fact.&quot; Statistical
      methods can help you make the &quot;best educated guess.&quot;</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Since you will undoubtedly be given statistical information at some point in your life, you
      need to know some techniques for analyzing the information thoughtfully. Think about buying a house or managing a
      budget. Think about your chosen profession. The fields of economics, business, psychology, education, biology,
      law, computer science, police science, and early childhood development require at least one course in statistics.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">Included in this book are the basic ideas and words of probability and statistics. You will
      soon understand that statistics and probability work together. You will also learn how data are gathered and what
      &quot;good&quot; data can be distinguished from &quot;bad&quot;.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Once you have collected data, what will you do with it? Data can be described and presented in
      many different formats. For example, suppose you are interested in buying a house in a particular area. You may
      have no clue about the house prices, so you might ask your real estate agent to give you a sample data set of
      prices. Looking at all the prices in the sample often is overwhelming. A better way might be to look at the median
      price and the variation of prices. The median and variation are just two ways that you will learn to describe
      data. Your agent might also provide you with a graph of the data.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">In this book, you will study numerical and graphical ways to describe and display your data.
      This area of statistics is called <strong>&quot;</strong>Descriptive Statistics&quot;. You will learn how to
      calculate, and even more importantly, how to interpret these measurements and graphs.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">A statistical graph is a tool that helps you learn about the shape or distribution of a sample
      or a population. A graph can be a more effective way of presenting data than a mass of numbers because we can see
      where data clusters and where there are only a few data values. Newspapers and the Internet use graphs to show
      trends and to enable readers to compare facts and figures quickly. Statisticians often graph data first to get a
      picture of the data. Then, more formal tools may be applied.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Some of the types of graphs that are used to summarize and organize data are the dot plot, the
      bar graph, the histogram, the stem-and-leaf plot, the frequency polygon (a type of broken line graph), the pie
      chart, and the box plot. In this book, we will look at stem-and-leaf plots, line graphs, and bar graphs, as well
      as frequency polygons, and time series graphs. Our emphasis will be on histograms and box plots.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">It is often necessary to &quot;guess&quot; about the outcome of an event in order to make a
      decision. Politicians study polls to guess their likelihood of winning an election. Teachers choose a particular
      course of study based on what they think students can comprehend. Doctors choose the treatments needed for various
      diseases based on their assessment of likely results. You may have visited a casino where people play games chosen
      because of the belief that the likelihood of winning is good. You may have chosen your course of study based on
      the probable availability of jobs.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">You have, more than likely, used probability. In fact, you probably have an intuitive sense of
      probability. Probability deals with the chance of an event occurring. Whenever you weigh the odds of whether or
      not to do your homework or to study for an exam, you are using probability. In this book, you will learn how to
      solve probability problems using a systematic approach.</p>

      <h2>Introduction [h2]</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">You are probably asking yourself the question, &quot;When and where will I use
        statistics?&quot; If you read any newspaper, watch television, or use the Internet, you will see statistical
        information. There are statistics about crime, sports, education, politics, and real estate. Typically, when you
        read a newspaper article or watch a television news program, you are given sample information. With this
        information, you may make a decision about the correctness of a statement, claim, or &quot;fact.&quot;
        Statistical methods can help you make the &quot;best educated guess.&quot;</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Since you will undoubtedly be given statistical information at some point in your life, you
        need to know some techniques for analyzing the information thoughtfully. Think about buying a house or managing
        a budget. Think about your chosen profession. The fields of economics, business, psychology, education, biology,
        law, computer science, police science, and early childhood development require at least one course in
        statistics.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Included in this chapter are the basic ideas and words of probability and statistics. You
        will soon understand that statistics and probability work together. You will also learn how data are gathered
        and what &quot;good&quot; data can be distinguished from &quot;bad&quot;.</p>

      <h3>Statistics [h3]</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">The science of <span class="key-term" data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">statistics</span>
        deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of <span class="key-term"
          data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">data</span>. We see and use data in our everyday lives.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">In this course, you will learn how to organize and summarize data. Organizing and summarizing
        data is called <span class="key-term" data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">descriptive statistics</span>. Two ways
        to summarize data are by graphing and by using numbers (for example, finding an average). After you have studied
        probability and probability distributions, you will use formal methods for drawing conclusions from
        &quot;good&quot; data. The formal methods are called <span class="key-term"
          data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">inferential statistics</span>. Statistical inference uses probability to
        determine how confident we can be that our conclusions are correct.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Effective interpretation of data (inference) is based on good procedures for producing data
        and thoughtful examination of the data. You will encounter what will seem to be too many mathematical formulas
        for interpreting data. The goal of statistics is not to perform numerous calculations using the formulas, but to
        gain an understanding of your data. The calculations can be done using a calculator or a computer. The
        understanding must come from you. If you can thoroughly grasp the basics of statistics, you can be more
        confident in the decisions you make in life.</p>
      <h3>Probability [h3]</h3>
      <p class="paragraph"><span class="key-term" data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">Probability</span> is a
        mathematical tool used to study randomness. It deals with the chance (the likelihood) of an event occurring. For
        example, if you toss a <span class="key-term" data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">fair</span> coin four times,
        the outcomes may not be two heads and two tails. However, if you toss the same coin 4,000 times, the outcomes
        will be close to half heads and half tails. The expected theoretical probability of heads in any one toss is
        1212 or 0.5. Even though the outcomes of a few repetitions are uncertain, there is a regular pattern of outcomes
        when there are many repetitions. After reading about the English statistician Karl <span class="key-term"
          data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">Pearson</span> who tossed a coin 24,000 times with a result of 12,012
        heads, one of the authors tossed a coin 2,000 times. The results were 996 heads. The fraction <span

        very close to 0.5, the expected probability.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The theory of probability began with the study of games of chance such as poker. Predictions
        take the form of probabilities. To predict the likelihood of an earthquake, of rain, or whether you will get an
        A in this course, we use probabilities. Doctors use probability to determine the chance of a vaccination causing
        the disease the vaccination is supposed to prevent. A stockbroker uses probability to determine the rate of
        return on a client&apos;s investments. You might use probability to decide to buy a lottery ticket or not. In
        your study of statistics, you will use the power of mathematics through probability calculations to analyze and
        interpret your data.</p>
      <h3>Key Terms [h3]</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">In statistics, we generally want to study a <span class="key-term"
          data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">population</span>. You can think of a population as a collection of
        persons, things, or objects under study. To study the population, we select a <span class="key-term"
          data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">sample</span>. The idea of <span class="key-term"
          data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">sampling</span> is to select a portion (or subset) of the larger population
        and study that portion (the sample) to gain information about the population. Data are the result of sampling
        from a population.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Because it takes a lot of time and money to examine an entire population, sampling is a very
        practical technique. If you wished to compute the overall grade point average at your school, it would make
        sense to select a sample of students who attend the school. The data collected from the sample would be the
        students&apos; grade point averages. In presidential elections, opinion poll samples of 1,000&#x2013;2,000
        people are taken. The opinion poll is supposed to represent the views of the people in the entire country.
        Manufacturers of canned carbonated drinks take samples to determine if a 16 ounce can contains 16 ounces of
        carbonated drink.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">From the sample data, we can calculate a statistic. A <span class="key-term"
          data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">statistic</span> is a number that represents a property of the sample. For
        example, if we consider one math class to be a sample of the population of all math classes, then the average
        number of points earned by students in that one math class at the end of the term is an example of a statistic.
        The statistic is an estimate of a population parameter, in this case the mean. A <span class="key-term"
          data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">parameter</span> is a numerical characteristic of the whole population that
        can be estimated by a statistic. Since we considered all math classes to be the population, then the average
        number of points earned per student over all the math classes is an example of a parameter.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">One of the main concerns in the field of statistics is how accurately a statistic estimates a
        parameter. The accuracy really depends on how well the sample represents the population. The sample must contain
        the characteristics of the population in order to be a <span class="key-term"
          data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">representative sample</span>. We are interested in both the sample
        statistic and the population parameter in inferential statistics. In a later chapter, we will use the sample
        statistic to test the validity of the established population parameter.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">A <span class="key-term" data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">variable</span>, or random
        variable, usually notated by capital letters such as <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>, is a characteristic or
        measurement that can be determined for each member of a population. Variables may be <span class="key-term"
          data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">numerical</span> or <span class="key-term"
          data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">categorical</span>. <span class="key-term"
          data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">Numerical variables</span> take on values with equal units such as weight
        in pounds and time in hours. <span class="key-term" data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">Categorical
          variables</span> place the person or thing into a category. If we let <em>X</em> equal the number of points
        earned by one math student at the end of a term, then <em>X</em> is a numerical variable. If we let <em>Y</em>
        be a person&apos;s party affiliation, then some examples of <em>Y</em> include Republican, Democrat, and
        Independent. <em>Y</em> is a categorical variable. We could do some math with values of <em>X</em> (calculate
        the average number of points earned, for example), but it makes no sense to do math with values of <em>Y</em>
        (calculating an average party affiliation makes no sense).</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><span class="key-term" data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">Data</span> are the actual values
        of the variable. They may be numbers or they may be words. <span class="key-term"
          data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">Datum</span> is a single value.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Two words that come up often in statistics are <span class="key-term"
          data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">mean</span> and <span class="key-term"
          data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">proportion</span>. If you were to take three exams in your math classes and
        obtain scores of 86, 75, and 92, you would calculate your mean score by adding the three exam scores and
        dividing by three (your mean score would be 84.3 to one decimal place). If, in your math class, there are 40
        students and 22 are men and 18 are women, then the proportion of men students is <span class="math-node"><span

      <p class="paragraph">Data may come from a population or from a sample. Lowercase letters like <em>x</em> or
        <em>y</em> generally are used to represent data values. Most data can be put into the following categories:</p>
      <ul>

      <p class="paragraph"><span class="key-term" data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">Qualitative data</span> are the
        result of categorizing or describing attributes of a population. <span class="key-term"
          data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">Qualitative data</span> are also often called categorical data. Hair color,
        blood type, ethnic group, the car a person drives, and the street a person lives on are examples of qualitative
        (categorical) data. Qualitative (categorical) data are generally described by words or letters. For instance,
        hair color might be black, dark brown, light brown, blonde, gray, or red. Blood type might be AB+, O&#x2212;, or
        B+. Researchers often prefer to use quantitative data over qualitative (categorical) data because it lends
        itself more easily to mathematical analysis. For example, it does not make sense to find an average hair color
        or blood type.</p>
      <p class="paragraph"><span class="key-term" data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">Quantitative data</span> are always

          data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">measuring</span> attributes of a population. Amount of money, pulse rate,
        weight, number of people living in your town, and number of students who take statistics are examples of
        quantitative data. Quantitative data may be either <span class="key-term"
          data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">discrete</span> or <span class="key-term"
          data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">continuous</span>.</p>

        values such as zero, one, two, or three.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Data that are not only made up of counting numbers, but that may include fractions, decimals,
        or irrational numbers, are called <span class="key-term" data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">quantitative

        A list of the lengths in minutes for all the phone calls that you make in a week, with numbers like 2.4, 7.5, or
        11.0, would be quantitative continuous data.</p>

      <h3>Qualitative Data Discussion [h3]</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">Below are tables comparing the number of part-time and full-time students at De Anza College
        and Foothill College enrolled for the spring 2010 quarter. The tables display counts (frequencies) and
        percentages or proportions (relative frequencies). The percent columns make comparing the same categories in the
        colleges easier. Displaying percentages along with the numbers is often helpful, but it is particularly
        important when comparing sets of data that do not have the same totals, such as the total enrollments for both
        colleges in this example. Notice how much larger the percentage for part-time students at Foothill College is
        compared to De Anza College.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">Tables are a good way of organizing and displaying data. But graphs can be even more helpful
        in understanding the data. There are no strict rules concerning which graphs to use. Two graphs that are used to
        display qualitative(categorical) data are pie charts and bar graphs.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">In a <span class="key-term" data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">pie chart</span>, categories
        of data are represented by wedges in a circle and are proportional in size to the percent of individuals in each
        category.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">In a <span class="key-term" data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">bar graph</span>, the length
        of the bar for each category is proportional to the number or percent of individuals in each category. Bars may
        be vertical or horizontal.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">A <span class="key-term" data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">Pareto chart</span> consists of
        bars that are sorted into order by category size (largest to smallest).</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Look at Figure 1.4 and Figure 1.5 and determine which graph (pie or bar) you think displays
        the comparisons better.</p>

      <aside class="short tip">
        <p class="paragraph">It is a good idea to look at a variety of graphs to see which is the most helpful in

      <p class="paragraph">Sometimes percentages add up to be more than 100% (or less than 100%). In the graph, the
        percentages add to more than 100% because students can be in more than one category. A bar graph is appropriate

      <h3>Sampling [h3]</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">Gathering information about an entire population often costs too much or is virtually
        impossible. Instead, we use a sample of the population. <strong>A sample should have the same characteristics as
          the population it is representing.</strong> Most statisticians use various methods of random sampling in an
        attempt to achieve this goal. This section will describe a few of the most common methods. There are several
        different methods of <span class="key-term" data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">random sampling</span>. In each
        form of random sampling, each member of a population initially has an equal chance of being selected for the
        sample. Each method has pros and cons. The easiest method to describe is called a <span class="key-term"
          data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">simple random sample</span>. Any group of <em>n</em> individuals is equally
        likely to be chosen as any other group of <em>n</em> individuals if the simple random sampling technique is
        used. In other words, each sample of the same size has an equal chance of being selected.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Besides simple random sampling, there are other forms of sampling that involve a chance
        process for getting the sample. <strong>Other well-known random sampling methods are the stratified sample, the
          cluster sample, and the systematic sample.</strong></p>
      <p class="paragraph">To choose a <span class="key-term" data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">stratified
          sample</span>, divide the population into groups called strata and then take a <span class="key-term"
          data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">proportionate</span> number from each stratum. For example, you could
        stratify (group) your college population by department and then choose a proportionate simple random sample from
        each stratum (each department) to get a stratified random sample. To choose a simple random sample from each
        department, number each member of the first department, number each member of the second department, and do the
        same for the remaining departments. Then use simple random sampling to choose proportionate numbers from the
        first department and do the same for each of the remaining departments. Those numbers picked from the first
        department, picked from the second department, and so on represent the members who make up the stratified
        sample.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">To choose a <span class="key-term" data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">cluster sample</span>,
        divide the population into clusters (groups) and then randomly select some of the clusters. All the members from
        these clusters are in the cluster sample. For example, if you randomly sample four departments from your college
        population, the four departments make up the cluster sample. Divide your college faculty by department. The
        departments are the clusters. Number each department, and then choose four different numbers using simple random
        sampling. All members of the four departments with those numbers are the cluster sample.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">To choose a <span class="key-term" data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">systematic
          sample</span>, randomly select a starting point and take every <em>n</em><sup>th</sup> piece of data from a
        listing of the population. For example, suppose you have to do a phone survey. Your phone book contains 20,000
        residence listings. You must choose 400 names for the sample. Number the population 1&#x2013;20,000 and then use
        a simple random sample to pick a number that represents the first name in the sample. Then choose every fiftieth
        name thereafter until you have a total of 400 names (you might have to go back to the beginning of your phone
        list). Systematic sampling is frequently chosen because it is a simple method.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">A type of sampling that is non-random is convenience sampling. <span class="key-term"
          data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">Convenience sampling</span> involves using results that are readily
        available. For example, a computer software store conducts a marketing study by interviewing potential customers
        who happen to be in the store browsing through the available software. The results of convenience sampling may
        be very good in some cases and highly biased (favor certain outcomes) in others.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Sampling data should be done very carefully. Collecting data carelessly can have devastating
        results. Surveys mailed to households and then returned may be very biased (they may favor a certain group). It
        is better for the person conducting the survey to select the sample respondents.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">True random sampling is done <span class="key-term" data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">with
          replacement</span>. That is, once a member is picked, that member goes back into the population and thus may
        be chosen more than once. However for practical reasons, in most populations, simple random sampling is done
        <span class="key-term" data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">without replacement</span>. Surveys are typically done
        without replacement. That is, a member of the population may be chosen only once. Most samples are taken from
        large populations and the sample tends to be small in comparison to the population. Since this is the case,
        sampling without replacement is approximately the same as sampling with replacement because the chance of
        picking the same individual more than once with replacement is very low.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Sampling without replacement instead of sampling with replacement becomes a mathematical
        issue only when the population is small.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">When you analyze data, it is important to be aware of <span class="key-term"
          data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">sampling errors</span> and nonsampling errors. The actual process of
        sampling causes sampling errors. For example, the sample may not be large enough. Factors not related to the
        sampling process cause <span class="key-term" data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">nonsampling errors</span>. A
        defective counting device can cause a nonsampling error.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">In reality, a sample will never be exactly representative of the population so there will
        always be some sampling error. As a rule, the larger the sample, the smaller the sampling error.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">In statistics, <span class="key-term" data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">a sampling
          bias</span> is created when a sample is collected from a population and some members of the population are not
        as likely to be chosen as others (remember, each member of the population should have an equally likely chance
        of being chosen). When a sampling bias happens, there can be incorrect conclusions drawn about the population
        that is being studied.</p>
      <h4>Critical Evaluation [h4]</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">We need to evaluate the statistical studies we read about critically and analyze them before
        accepting the results of the studies. Common problems to be aware of include</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p class="paragraph">Problems with samples: A sample must be representative of the population. A sample that
            is not representative of the population is biased. Biased samples that are not representative of the
            population give results that are inaccurate and not valid.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="paragraph">Self-selected samples: Responses only by people who choose to respond, such as call-in
            surveys, are often unreliable.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="paragraph">Sample size issues: Samples that are too small may be unreliable. Larger samples are
            better, if possible. In some situations, having small samples is unavoidable and can still be used to draw
            conclusions. Examples: crash testing cars or medical testing for rare conditions</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="paragraph">Undue influence: &#xA0;collecting data or asking questions in a way that influences the
            response</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="paragraph">Non-response or refusal of subject to participate: &#xA0;The collected responses may no
            longer be representative of the population. &#xA0;Often, people with strong positive or negative opinions
            may answer surveys, which can affect the results.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="paragraph">Causality: A relationship between two variables does not mean that one causes the other
            to occur. They may be related (correlated) because of their relationship through a different variable.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="paragraph">Self-funded or self-interest studies: A study performed by a person or organization in
            order to support their claim. Is the study impartial? Read the study carefully to evaluate the work. Do not
            automatically assume that the study is good, but do not automatically assume the study is bad either.
            Evaluate it on its merits and the work done.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="paragraph">Misleading use of data: improperly displayed graphs, incomplete data, or lack of context
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="paragraph">Confounding: &#xA0;When the effects of multiple factors on a response cannot be
            separated. &#xA0;Confounding makes it difficult or impossible to draw valid conclusions about the effect of
            each factor.</p>

        <h3>Example 1.13 [h3]</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">Suppose ABC College has 10,000 part-time students (the population). We are interested in
          the average amount of money a part-time student spends on books in the fall term. Asking all 10,000 students
          is an almost impossible task.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Suppose we take two different samples.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">First, we use convenience sampling and survey ten students from a first term organic
          chemistry class. Many of these students are taking first term calculus in addition to the organic chemistry
          class. The amount of money they spend on books is as follows:</p>
        <p class="paragraph">$128; $87; $173; $116; $130; $204; $147; $189; $93; $153</p>
        <p class="paragraph">The second sample is taken using a list of senior citizens who take P.E. classes and taking
          every fifth senior citizen on the list, for a total of ten senior citizens. They spend:</p>
        <p class="paragraph">$50; $40; $36; $15; $50; $100; $40; $53; $22; $22</p>
        <p class="paragraph">It is unlikely that any student is in both samples.</p>
        <h4>Problem [h4]</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">a. Do you think that either of these samples is representative of (or is characteristic of)
          the entire 10,000 part-time student population?</p>
        <h4>Solution [h4]</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">a. No. The first sample probably consists of science-oriented students. Besides the
          chemistry course, some of them are also taking first-term calculus. Books for these classes tend to be
          expensive. Most of these students are, more than likely, paying more than the average part-time student for
          their books. The second sample is a group of senior citizens who are, more than likely, taking courses for
          health and interest. The amount of money they spend on books is probably much less than the average parttime
          student. Both samples are biased. Also, in both cases, not all students have a chance to be in either sample.
        </p>
        <h4>Problem [h4]</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">b. Since these samples are not representative of the entire population, is it wise to use
          the results to describe the entire population?</p>
        <h4>Solution [h4]</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">b. No. For these samples, each member of the population did not have an equally likely
          chance of being chosen.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Now, suppose we take a third sample. We choose ten different part-time students from the
          disciplines of chemistry, math, English, psychology, sociology, history, nursing, physical education, art, and
          early childhood development. (We assume that these are the only disciplines in which part-time students at ABC
          College are enrolled and that an equal number of part-time students are enrolled in each of the disciplines.)
          Each student is chosen using simple random sampling. Using a calculator, random numbers are generated and a
          student from a particular discipline is selected if he or she has a corresponding number. The students spend
          the following amounts:</p>
        <p class="paragraph">$180; $50; $150; $85; $260; $75; $180; $200; $200; $150</p>
        <h4>Problem [h4]</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">c. Is the sample biased?</p>
        <h4>Solution [h4]</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">c. The sample is unbiased, but a larger sample would be recommended to increase the
          likelihood that the sample will be close to representative of the population. However, for a biased sampling
          technique, even a large sample runs the risk of not being representative of the population.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Students often ask if it is &quot;good enough&quot; to take a sample, instead of surveying
          the entire population. If the survey is done well, the answer is yes.</p>

      <h3>Variation in Data [h3]</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">Variation is present in any set of data. For example, 16-ounce cans of beverage may contain
        more or less than 16 ounces of liquid. In one study, eight 16 ounce cans were measured and produced the
        following amount (in ounces) of beverage:</p>
      <p class="paragraph">15.8; 16.1; 15.2; 14.8; 15.8; 15.9; 16.0; 15.5</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Measurements of the amount of beverage in a 16-ounce can may vary because different people
        make the measurements or because the exact amount, 16 ounces of liquid, was not put into the cans. Manufacturers
        regularly run tests to determine if the amount of beverage in a 16-ounce can falls within the desired range.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Be aware that as you take data, your data may vary somewhat from the data someone else is
        taking for the same purpose. This is completely natural. However, if two or more of you are taking the same data
        and get very different results, it is time for you and the others to reevaluate your data-taking methods and
        your accuracy.</p>
      <h3>Variation in Samples [h3]</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">It was mentioned previously that two or more samples from the same population, taken
        randomly, and having close to the same characteristics of the population will likely be different from each
        other. Suppose Doreen and Jung both decide to study the average amount of time students at their college sleep
        each night. Doreen and Jung each take samples of 500 students. Doreen uses systematic sampling and Jung uses
        cluster sampling. Doreen&apos;s sample will be different from Jung&apos;s sample. Even if Doreen and Jung used
        the same sampling method, in all likelihood their samples would be different. Neither would be wrong, however.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">Think about what contributes to making Doreen&#x2019;s and Jung&#x2019;s samples different.
      </p>

        <h3>The Scottish Widows Fund [h3]</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">In 1744 two Scottish ministers, Alexander Webster and Robert Wallace, decided to set up a
          life insurance fund. The idea being that it would provide for widows and children of dead clergymen.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">They proposed that each minister would pay a section of his monthly salary into a savings
          fund, but how should they determine the amount?</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Being practical types they contacted a mathematics professor from the University of
          Edinburgh, Colin McClory. The three men then collected statistical data on death rates, numbers of children
          and years that widows outlived their husbands or remarried.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">They used Jacob Bernouli&#x2019;s &#x2018;Law of Large Numbers&#x2019;, which states that
          it&#x2019;s hard to predict (with certainty) a single event. But, it&#x2019;s possible to accurately predict
          the average outcome of many, similar events.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">After their calculations were totted up. They determined that each clergyman needed to give
          at least &#xA3;2, 12 shillings and twopence to guarantee a comfortable pension. They could also, if they
          wished, contribute as much as &#xA3;6, 11 shillings and threepence.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">They predicted that by 1765 the fund would be &#xA3;58,348. In fact, the actual amount
          ended up being &#xA3;58,347. Just &#xA3;1 off the prediction!</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Jacob Bernoulli&apos;s father, Nicolaus Bernoulli (1623-1708) inherited the spice business
          in Basel that had been set up by his own father, first in Amsterdam and then in Basel. The family, of Belgium
          origin, were refugees fleeing from persecution by the Spanish rulers of the Netherlands. Philip, the King of
          Spain, had sent the Duke of Alba to the Netherlands in 1567 with a large army to punish those opposed to
          Spanish rule, to enforce adherence to Roman Catholicism, and to re-establish Philip&apos;s authority. Alba set
          up the Council of Troubles which was a court that condemned over 12000 people but most, like the Bernoulli
          family who were of the Protestant faith, fled the country.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Nicolaus Bernoulli was an important citizen of Basel, being a member of the town council
          and a magistrate. Jacob Bernoulli&apos;s mother also came from an important Basel family of bankers and local
          councillors. Jacob Bernoulli was the brother of Johann Bernoulli and the uncle of Daniel Bernoulli. He was
          compelled to study philosophy and theology by his parents, which he greatly resented, and he graduated from
          the University of Basel with a master&apos;s degree in philosophy in 1671 and a licentiate in theology in
          1676.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">During the time that Jacob Bernoulli was taking his university degrees he was studying
          mathematics and astronomy against the wishes of his parents. It is worth remarking that this was a typical
          pattern for many of the Bernoulli family who made a study of mathematics despite pressure to make a career in
          other areas. However Jacob Bernoulli was the first to go down this road so for him it was rather different in
          that there was no tradition of mathematics in the family before Jacob Bernoulli. Later members of the family
          must have been much influenced by the tradition of studying mathematics and mathematical physics.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">In 1676, after taking his theology degree, Bernoulli moved to Geneva where he worked as a
          tutor. He then travelled to France spending two years studying with the followers of Descartes who were led at
          this time by Malebranche. In 1681 Bernoulli travelled to the Netherlands where he met many mathematicians
          including Hudde. Continuing his studies with the leading mathematicians and scientists of Europe he went to
          England where, among others, he met Boyle and Hooke. At this time he was deeply interested in astronomy and
          produced a work giving an incorrect theory of comets. As a result of his travels, Bernoulli began a
          correspondence with many mathematicians which he carried on over many years.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Jacob Bernoulli returned to Switzerland and taught mechanics at the University in Basel
          from 1683, giving a series of important lectures on the mechanics of solids and liquids. Since his degree was
          in theology it would have been natural for him to turn to the Church, but although he was offered an
          appointment in the Church he turned it down. Bernoulli&apos;s real love was for mathematics and theoretical
          physics and it was in these topics that he taught and researched. During this period he studied the leading
          mathematical works of his time including Descartes&apos; G&#xE9;om&#xE9;trie and van Schooten&apos;s
          additional material in the Latin edition. Jacob Bernoulli also studied the work of Wallis and Barrow and
          through these he became interested in infinitesimal geometry. Jacob began publishing in the journal Acta
          Eruditorum which was established in Leipzig in 1682.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">In 1684 Jacob Bernoulli married Judith Stupanus. They were to have two children, a son who
          was given his grandfather&apos;s name of Nicolaus and a daughter. These children, unlike many members of the
          Bernoulli family, did not go on to become mathematicians or physicists.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">One of the most significant events concerning the mathematical studies of Jacob Bernoulli
          occurred when his younger brother, Johann Bernoulli, began to work on mathematical topics. Johann was told by
          his father to study medicine but while he was studying that topic he asked his brother Jacob to teach him
          mathematics. Jacob Bernoulli was appointed professor of mathematics in Basel in 1687 and the two brothers
          began to study the calculus as presented by Leibniz in his 1684 paper on the differential calculus in Nova
          Methodus pro Maximis et Minimis, itemque Tangentibus... published in Acta Eruditorum. They also studied the
          publications of von Tschirnhaus. It must be understood that Leibniz&apos;s publications on the calculus were
          very obscure to mathematicians of that time and the Bernoullis were the first to try to understand and apply
          Leibniz&apos;s theories.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Although Jacob and Johann both worked on similar problems their relationship was soon to
          change from one of collaborators to one of rivals. Johann Bernoulli&apos;s boasts were the first cause of
          Jacob&apos;s attacks on him and Jacob wrote that Johann was his pupil whose only achievements were to repeat
          what his teacher had taught him. Of course this was a grossly unfair statement. Jacob continued to attack his
          brother in print in a disgraceful and unnecessary fashion, particularly after 1697. However he did not reserve
          public criticism for his brother. He was critical of the university authorities at Basel and again he was very
          public in making critical statements that, as one would expect, left him in a difficult situation at the
          university. Jacob probably felt that Johann was the more powerful mathematician of the two and, this hurt
          since Jacob&apos;s nature meant that he always had to feel that he was winning praise from all sides. Hofmann
          writes:</p>
        <p class="paragraph">[blockquote]</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="paragraph">Sensitivity, irritability, a mutual passion for criticism, and an exaggerated need for
            recognition alienated the brothers, of whom Jacob had the slower but deeper intellect.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="paragraph">[/blockquote]</p>
        <p class="paragraph">As suggested by this quote the brothers were equally at fault in their quarrel. Johann
          would have liked the chair of mathematics at Basel which Jacob held and he certainly resented having to move
          to Holland in 1695. This was another factor in the complete breakdown of relations in 1697.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Of course the dispute between the brothers over who could obtain the greatest recognition
          was a particularly stupid one in the sense that both made contributions to mathematics of the very greatest
          importance. Whether the rivalry spurred them on to greater things or whether they might have achieved more had
          they continued their initial collaboration, it is impossible to say. We shall now examine some of the major
          contributions made by Jacob Bernoulli at an important stage in the development of mathematics following
          Leibniz&apos;s work on the calculus.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Jacob Bernoulli&apos;s first important contributions were a pamphlet on the parallels of
          logic and algebra published in 1685, work on probability in 1685 and geometry in 1687. His geometry result
          gave a construction to divide any triangle into four equal parts with two perpendicular lines.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">By 1689 he had published important work on infinite series and published his law of large
          numbers in probability theory. The interpretation of probability as relative-frequency says that if an
          experiment is repeated a large number of times then the relative frequency with which an event occurs equals
          the probability of the event. The law of large numbers is a mathematical interpretation of this result. Jacob
          Bernoulli published five treatises on infinite series between 1682 and 1704. The first two of these contained
          many results, such as fundamental result that <span class="math-node"><span class="katex"><span

          limit less than 2. Euler was the first to find the sum of this series in 1737. Bernoulli also studied the
          exponential series which came out of examining compound interest.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">In May 1690 in a paper published in Acta Eruditorum, Jacob Bernoulli showed that the
          problem of determining the isochrone is equivalent to solving a first-order nonlinear differential equation.
          The isochrone, or curve of constant descent, is the curve along which a particle will descend under gravity
          from any point to the bottom in exactly the same time, no matter what the starting point. It had been studied
          by Huygens in 1687 and Leibniz in 1689. After finding the differential equation, Bernoulli then solved it by
          what we now call separation of variables. Jacob Bernoulli&apos;s paper of 1690 is important for the history of
          calculus, since the term integral appears for the first time with its integration meaning. In 1696 Bernoulli
          solved the equation, now called &quot;the Bernoulli equation&quot;, <span class="math-node"><span

        <p class="paragraph">Jacob Bernoulli also discovered a general method to determine evolutes of a curve as the
          envelope of its circles of curvature. He also investigated caustic curves and in particular he studied these
          associated curves of the parabola, the logarithmic spiral and epicycloids around 1692. The lemniscate of
          Bernoulli was first conceived by Jacob Bernoulli in 1694. In 1695 he investigated the drawbridge problem which
          seeks the curve required so that a weight sliding along the cable always keeps the drawbridge balanced.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Jacob Bernoulli&apos;s most original work was Ars Conjectandi published in Basel in 1713,
          eight years after his death. The work was incomplete at the time of his death but it is still a work of the
          greatest significance in the theory of probability. In the book Bernoulli reviewed work of others on
          probability, in particular work by van Schooten, Leibniz, and Prestet. The Bernoulli numbers appear in the
          book in a discussion of the exponential series. Many examples are given on how much one would expect to win
          playing various game of chance. There are interesting thoughts on what probability really is:</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Hofmann sums up Jacob Bernoulli&apos;s contributions as follows:</p>
        <p class="paragraph">[blockquote]</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="paragraph">Bernoulli greatly advanced algebra, the infinitesimal calculus, the calculus of
            variations, mechanics, the theory of series, and the theory of probability. He was self-willed, obstinate,
            aggressive, vindictive, beset by feelings of inferiority, and yet firmly convinced of his own abilities.
            With these characteristics, he necessarily had to collide with his similarly disposed brother. He
            nevertheless exerted the most lasting influence on the latter.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="paragraph">[/blockquote]</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Bernoulli was one of the most significant promoters of the formal methods of higher
          analysis. Astuteness and elegance are seldom found in his method of presentation and expression, but there is
          a maximum of integrity.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Jacob Bernoulli continued to hold the chair of mathematics at Basel until his death in 1705
          when the chair was filled by his brother Johann. Jacob had always found the properties of the logarithmic
          spiral to be almost magical and he had requested that it be carved on his tombstone with the Latin inscription
          Eadem Mutata Resurgo meaning &quot;Although changed, I will rise again the same&quot;.</p>

      <h4>Size of a Sample [h4]</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">The size of a sample (often called the number of observations, usually given the symbol n) is
        important. The examples you have seen in this book so far have been small. Samples of only a few hundred
        observations, or even smaller, are sufficient for many purposes. In polling, samples that are from 1,200 to
        1,500 observations are considered large enough and good enough if the survey is random and is well done. Later
        we will find that even much smaller sample sizes will give very good results. You will learn why when you study
        confidence intervals.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Be aware that many large samples are biased. For example, call-in surveys are invariably
        biased, because people choose to respond or not.</p>

      <h2>1.3 Levels of Measurement [h2]</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">Once you have a set of data, you will need to organize it so that you can analyze how
        frequently each datum occurs in the set. However, when calculating the frequency, you may need to round your
        answers so that they are as precise as possible.</p>
      <h3>Levels of Measurement [h3]</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">The way a set of data is measured is called its <span class="key-term"
          data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">level of measurement</span>. Correct statistical procedures depend on a
        researcher being familiar with levels of measurement. Not every statistical operation can be used with every set
        of data. Data can be classified into four levels of measurement. They are (from lowest to highest level):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p class="paragraph"><span class="key-term" data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">Nominal scale level</span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="paragraph"><span class="key-term" data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">Ordinal scale level</span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="paragraph"><span class="key-term" data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">Interval scale level</span></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="paragraph"><span class="key-term" data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">Ratio scale level</span></p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="paragraph">Data that is measured using a <span class="key-term"
          data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">nominal scale</span> is <span class="key-term"
          data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">qualitative (categorical)</span>. Categories, colors, names, labels and
        favorite foods along with yes or no responses are examples of nominal level data. Nominal scale data are not
        ordered. For example, trying to classify people according to their favorite food does not make any sense.
        Putting pizza first and sushi second is not meaningful.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Smartphone companies are another example of nominal scale data. The data are the names of the
        companies that make smartphones, but there is no agreed upon order of these brands, even though people may have
        personal preferences. Nominal scale data cannot be used in calculations.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Data that is measured using an <span class="key-term"
          data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">ordinal scale</span> is similar to nominal scale data but there is a big
        difference. The ordinal scale data can be ordered. An example of ordinal scale data is a list of the top five
        national parks in the United States. The top five national parks in the United States can be ranked from one to
        five but we cannot measure differences between the data.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Another example of using the ordinal scale is a cruise survey where the responses to
        questions about the cruise are &#x201C;excellent,&#x201D; &#x201C;good,&#x201D; &#x201C;satisfactory,&#x201D;
        and &#x201C;unsatisfactory.&#x201D; These responses are ordered from the most desired response to the least
        desired. But the differences between two pieces of data cannot be measured. Like the nominal scale data, ordinal
        scale data cannot be used in calculations.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Data that is measured using the <span class="key-term"
          data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">interval scale</span> is similar to ordinal level data because it has a
        definite ordering but there is a difference between data. The differences between interval scale data can be
        measured though the data does not have a starting point.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Temperature scales like Celsius (C) and Fahrenheit (F) are measured by using the interval
        scale. In both temperature measurements, 40&#xB0; is equal to 100&#xB0; minus 60&#xB0;. Differences make sense.
        But 0 degrees does not because, in both scales, 0 is not the absolute lowest temperature. Temperatures like
        &#x2212;10&#xB0; F and &#x2212;15&#xB0; C exist and are colder than 0.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Interval level data can be used in calculations, but one type of comparison cannot be done.
        80&#xB0; C is not four times as hot as 20&#xB0; C (nor is 80&#xB0; F four times as hot as 20&#xB0; F). There is
        no meaning to the ratio of 80 to 20 (or four to one).</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Data that is measured using the <span class="key-term"
          data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">ratio scale</span> takes care of the ratio problem and gives you the most
        information. Ratio scale data is like interval scale data, but it has a 0 point and ratios can be calculated.
        For example, four multiple choice statistics final exam scores are 80, 68, 20 and 92 (out of a possible 100
        points). The exams are machine-graded.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The data can be put in order from lowest to highest: 20, 68, 80, 92.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The differences between the data have meaning. The score 92 is more than the score 68 by 24
        points. Ratios can be calculated. The smallest score is 0. So 80 is four times 20. The score of 80 is four times
        better than the score of 20.</p>
      <h3>Frequency [h3]</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">Twenty students were asked how many hours they worked per day. Their responses, in hours, are
        as follows: 5; 6; 3; 3; 2; 4; 7; 5; 2; 3; 5; 6; 5; 4; 4; 3; 5; 2; 5; 3.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">A <span class="key-term" data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">frequency</span> is the number of
        times a value of the data occurs. According to Table 1.5, there are three students who work two hours, five
        students who work three hours, and so on. The sum of the values in the frequency column, 20, represents the

        the total number of outcomes. To find the relative frequencies, divide each frequency by the total number of
        students in the sample&#x2013;in this case, 20. Relative frequencies can be written as fractions, percents, or

      <p class="paragraph">Does aspirin reduce the risk of heart attacks? Is one brand of fertilizer more effective at
        growing roses than another? Is fatigue as dangerous to a driver as the influence of alcohol? Questions like
        these are answered using randomized experiments. In this module, you will learn important aspects of
        experimental design. Proper study design ensures the production of reliable, accurate data.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The purpose of an experiment is to investigate the relationship between two variables. When
        one variable causes change in another, we call the first variable the <span class="key-term"
          data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">independent variable</span> or <span class="key-term"
          data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">explanatory variable</span>. The affected variable is called the <span
          class="key-term" data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">dependent variable</span> or <span class="key-term"
          data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">response variable</span>: stimulus, response. In a randomized experiment,
        the researcher manipulates values of the explanatory variable and measures the resulting changes in the response
        variable. The different values of the explanatory variable are called <span class="key-term"
          data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">treatments</span>. An <span class="key-term"
          data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">experimental unit</span> is a single object or individual to be measured.

      <p class="paragraph">You want to investigate the effectiveness of vitamin E in preventing disease. You recruit a
        group of subjects and ask them if they regularly take vitamin E. You notice that the subjects who take vitamin E
        exhibit better health on average than those who do not. Does this prove that vitamin E is effective in disease
        prevention? It does not. There are many differences between the two groups compared in addition to vitamin E
        consumption. People who take vitamin E regularly often take other steps to improve their health: exercise, diet,
        other vitamin supplements, choosing not to smoke. Any one of these factors could be influencing health. As
        described, this study does not prove that vitamin E is the key to disease prevention.</p>

      <p class="extract-prose">Statistics is, or should be, about scientific investigation and how to do it better, but
        many statisticians believe it is a branch of mathematics. Now I agree that the physicist, the chemist, the
        engineer, and the statistician can never know too much mathematics, but their objectives should be better
        physics, better chemistry, better engineering, and in the case of statistics, better scientific investigation.
        Whether in any given study this implies more or less mathematics is incidental.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">Additional variables that can cloud a study are called <span class="key-term"
          data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">lurking variables</span>. In order to prove that the explanatory variable
        is causing a change in the response variable, it is necessary to isolate the explanatory variable. The
        researcher must design her experiment in such a way that there is only one difference between groups being
        compared: the planned treatments. This is accomplished by the <span class="key-term"
          data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">random assignment</span> of experimental units to treatment groups. When
        subjects are assigned treatments randomly, all of the potential lurking variables are spread equally among the
        groups. At this point the only difference between groups is the one imposed by the researcher. Different
        outcomes measured in the response variable, therefore, must be a direct result of the different treatments. In
        this way, an experiment can prove a cause-and-effect connection between the explanatory and response variables.

      <p class="paragraph">The power of suggestion can have an important influence on the outcome of an experiment.
        Studies have shown that the expectation of the study participant can be as important as the actual medication.
        In one study of performance-enhancing drugs, researchers noted:</p>
      <p class="paragraph">[blockquote]</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="paragraph">Results showed that believing one had taken the substance resulted in [performance] times
          almost as fast as those associated with consuming the drug itself. In contrast, taking the drug without
          knowledge yielded no significant performance increment.</p>

      <p class="paragraph">When participation in a study prompts a physical response from a participant, it is difficult
        to isolate the effects of the explanatory variable. To counter the power of suggestion, researchers set aside
        one treatment group as a <span class="key-term" data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">control group</span>. This
        group is given a <span class="key-term" data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">placebo</span> treatment&#x2013;a
        treatment that cannot influence the response variable. The control group helps researchers balance the effects
        of being in an experiment with the effects of the active treatments. Of course, if you are participating in a
        study and you know that you are receiving a pill which contains no actual medication, then the power of
        suggestion is no longer a factor. <span class="key-term" data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">Blinding</span> in a
        randomized experiment preserves the power of suggestion. When a person involved in a research study is blinded,
        he does not know who is receiving the active treatment(s) and who is receiving the placebo treatment. A <span
          class="key-term" data-tags="[&quot;key-term&quot;]">double-blind experiment</span> is one in which both the
        subjects and the researchers involved with the subjects are blinded.</p>

        <h3>Example 1.19 [h3]</h3>
        <h4>Problem [h4]</h4>
        <p class="paragraph">The Smell &amp; Taste Treatment and Research Foundation conducted a study to investigate
          whether smell can affect learning. Subjects completed mazes multiple times while wearing masks. They completed
          the pencil and paper mazes three times wearing floral-scented masks, and three times with unscented masks.
          Participants were assigned at random to wear the floral mask during the first three trials or during the last
          three trials. For each trial, researchers recorded the time it took to complete the maze and the
          subject&#x2019;s impression of the mask&#x2019;s scent: positive, negative, or neutral.</p>

        </ol>
        <h4>Solution [h4]</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p class="paragraph">The explanatory variable is scent, and the response variable is the time it takes to
              complete the maze.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="paragraph">There are two treatments: a floral-scented mask and an unscented mask.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="paragraph">All subjects experienced both treatments. The order of treatments was randomly assigned
              so there were no differences between the treatment groups. Random assignment eliminates the problem of
              lurking variables.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="paragraph">Subjects will clearly know whether they can smell flowers or not, so subjects cannot be
              blinded in this study. Researchers timing the mazes can be blinded, though. The researcher who is
              observing a subject will not know which mask is being worn.</p>

      <h2>Chapter review [h2]</h2>
      <h3>1.1 Definitions of Statistics, Probability, and Key Terms [h3]</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">The mathematical theory of statistics is easier to learn when you know the language. This
        module presents important terms that will be used throughout the text.</p>
      <h3>1.2 Data, Sampling, and Variation in Data and Sampling [h3]</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">Data are individual items of information that come from a population or sample. Data may be
        classified as qualitative (categorical), quantitative continuous, or quantitative discrete.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Because it is not practical to measure the entire population in a study, researchers use
        samples to represent the population. A random sample is a representative group from the population chosen by
        using a method that gives each individual in the population an equal chance of being included in the sample.
        Random sampling methods include simple random sampling, stratified sampling, cluster sampling, and systematic
        sampling. Convenience sampling is a nonrandom method of choosing a sample that often produces biased data.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Samples that contain different individuals result in different data. This is true even when
        the samples are well-chosen and representative of the population. When properly selected, larger samples model
        the population more closely than smaller samples. There are many different potential problems that can affect
        the reliability of a sample. Statistical data needs to be critically analyzed, not simply accepted.</p>
      <h3>1.3 Levels of Measurement [h3]</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">Some calculations generate numbers that are artificially precise. It is not necessary to
        report a value to eight decimal places when the measures that generated that value were only accurate to the
        nearest tenth. Round off your final answer to one more decimal place than was present in the original data. This
        means that if you have data measured to the nearest tenth of a unit, report the final statistic to the nearest
        hundredth.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">In addition to rounding your answers, you can measure your data using the following four
        levels of measurement.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Nominal scale level: data that cannot be ordered nor can it be used in calculations</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Ordinal scale level: data that can be ordered; the differences cannot be measured</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Interval scale level: data with a definite ordering but no starting point; the differences
        can be measured, but there is no such thing as a ratio.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Ratio scale level: data with a starting point that can be ordered; the differences have
        meaning and ratios can be calculated.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">When organizing data, it is important to know how many times a value appears. How many
        statistics students study five hours or more for an exam? What percent of families on our block own two pets?
        Frequency, relative frequency, and cumulative relative frequency are measures that answer questions like these.
      </p>
      <h3>1.4 Experimental Design and Ethics [h3]</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">A poorly designed study will not produce reliable data. There are certain key components that
        must be included in every experiment. To eliminate lurking variables, subjects must be assigned randomly to
        different treatment groups. One of the groups must act as a control group, demonstrating what happens when the
        active treatment is not applied. Participants in the control group receive a placebo treatment that looks
        exactly like the active treatments but cannot influence the response variable. To preserve the integrity of the
        placebo, both researchers and subjects may be blinded. When a study is designed properly, the only difference
        between treatment groups is the one imposed by the researcher. Therefore, when groups respond differently to
        different treatments, the difference must be due to the influence of the explanatory variable.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">&#x201C;An ethics problem arises when you are considering an action that benefits you or some
        cause you support, hurts or reduces benefits to others, and violates some rule.&#x201D; (Andrew Gelman,
        &#x201C;Open Data and Open Methods,&#x201D; Ethics and Statistics,
        http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/ChanceEthics1.pdf (accessed May 1, 2013).) Ethical
        violations in statistics are not always easy to spot. Professional associations and federal agencies post
        guidelines for proper conduct. It is important that you learn basic statistical procedures so that you can
        recognize proper data analysis.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">OpenStax is part of Rice University, which is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit charitable corporation. As

      and our alliance with other <a href="https://openstax.org/partners" rel target="blank">educational resource
        companies</a>, we&apos;re breaking down the most common barriers to learning. Because we believe that everyone
      should and can have access to knowledge.</p>

    <h2>What we do [h2]</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">We publish high-quality, peer-reviewed, openly licensed college textbooks that are absolutely
      free online and low cost in print. <strong>Seriously</strong>. We&apos;ve also developed a low-cost,
      research-based courseware that gives students the tools they need to complete their course the first time around.
      Check out our <a href="https://openstax.org/subjects" rel target="blank">current library</a> of textbooks and

    <h2>Where we&apos;re going [h2]</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">Our textbooks are being used in 60% of college and universities in the U.S. and over 100
      countries, but there&#x2019;s still room to grow. Alongside our efforts to expand our library, we have been taking
      steps toward <a href="https://openstax.org/openstax-tutor" rel target="blank">improving student learning</a> and
      advancing <a href="https://openstax.org/research" rel target="blank">research in learning science</a>. Access is
      just the beginning &#x2013; we want to make educational tools better for a new generation of learners. <a
